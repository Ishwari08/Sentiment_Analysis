# Sentiment_Analysis

##  Problem Definition
To build and develop a sentiment analysis based on short textual information and diffusion patterns 
using random forest machine learning algorithms.

##  Project Scope
- The ability to detect and track a userâ€™s state of mind has the potential to allow a computing system to 
  offer relevant information when a user needs help not just when the user requests help. 
- Find sentiment polarities expressed in Twitter messages. 
- Find sentiments i.e., positive, negative, and neutral.

## Project Objectives
The main aim of this project report are as follows: 
- To collect a relevant dataset of tweets from Twitter's API. 
- To preprocess the collected data to remove noise, handle special characters, normalize the text. 
- To perform feature extraction to represent tweets as numerical vectors suitable for machine learning 
  algorithms. 
- To train a Random Forest classifier on the labeled data to predict sentiment labels. 
- To evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics. 
- To analyze and interpret the results to gain insights into the sentiment patterns. 
- To classify the sentiment polarity of a Twitter message as positive, neutral, or negative. 
- To test system using real streaming using Twitter API. 
- Try to improve accuracy using machine learning algorithm. 
- To help people in sentiments-related research to improve the processing of data.
